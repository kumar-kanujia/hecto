# Terminal Text Editor (Learning Project)

This is a **terminal-based text editor written in Rust**, created by following the **Hecto** tutorial series by Philipp Flenker.

At the moment, this project is **not an original implementation** — it closely follows the guide step by step and exists purely as a learning exercise.

## 📖 About the Guide

This project is based on the **Hecto – Build Your Own Text Editor** tutorial:

https://philippflenker.com/hecto/

All design decisions, architecture, and implementation approach come from the guide.
Full credit for the editor design and teaching approach goes to **Philipp Flenker**.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Learn low-level terminal handling in Rust
- Understand how a text editor works internally
- Practice Rust in a non-trivial, stateful application
- Explore raw mode input, rendering, and editor loops

This repository mainly serves as:

- A personal learning log
- A reference while following the tutorial
- A base for future experimentation once the guide is complete

---

## 🦀 Language & Platform

- **Language:** Rust
- **Platform:** Terminal (Unix-like systems)
- **Environment:** Raw terminal mode

---

## 🚧 Current Status

- Actively following the Hecto tutorial
- Features and structure match the guide
- No major deviations yet

Once the tutorial is complete, this project may evolve independently.

## 📝 Notes

This repository is intentionally simple and mirrors the tutorial closely.
There is no contribution guide and no expectation of external contributions at this stage.
